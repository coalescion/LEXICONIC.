        We are all in the stream, and we can never truly step out of the stream to get the a good perspective on
        what the stream actually isâ€”however, we can, and should, examine the riverbank with scrutiny;
        for the riverbank is to us as the fly bottle is to the fly and the hurdle is to the philosopher.
