        you're playing 2k (a basketball video game) and running around the court. you catch a pass, dribble, and shoot just as you normally would,
        but something seems a little off—your character appears to act at slightly different times than you prompt with the controller.
    </p>
    <p id="descrip2" class="hidden">
        you need to determine if you are still really the one in control. so you move in the most unpredictable, nonsensical way possible.
        your character doesn't respond—they just continue moving in the way that makes the most sense. they move around the court, dribble, and shoot
        as any average player would normally do.

        sometimes we must act in the most random, unexpected, abnormal, seemingly pointless way we can in order to take control of our own automomy; 
        to prove to ourselves that we are the ones in control of our lives.
        this could be as simple as standing on one foot on a tree stump in a public park or taking a slightly different route to work than usual—it
        is a matter of distancing yourself from unconsciously responding to stimulus and instead acting in a way unique to you.
