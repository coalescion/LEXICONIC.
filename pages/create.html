        the end goal of &thinsp;<a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a> is to create a medium that allows anyone to 
        impact the collective consciousness in a way that promotes universal understanding. we want to provide people from all walks of life
        with a way to share their own personal bits of wisdom with the world. if youâ€™re interested in becoming part
        of the movement, enter your phrase with a description below. from there, we can begin the process of adding your wisdom
        to the website, and even create stickers for you and others to embed in the real world.
