    <p id="descrip1" class="hidden">our modern society is built on
    answer finding.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip2" class="hidden"> useful, but limited,
    frameworks—like logic, mathematics, and the scientific method—have allowed
    humans to accomplish great feats of science and engineering. however, the
    method of answer finding is not an approach to life.
    it is not an approach to wisdom. and it is not an approach to a deep, intimate understanding of and connection with reality itself.</p>
    
    <pre id="descrip3" class="hidden">some questions feel fundamental to the human condition. these include:
<span class="bullet-line">        - what is the meaning of life?</span>
<span class="bullet-line">        - is there a god? if so, what is god?</span>
<span class="bullet-line">        - what should I do with my life?</span>
<span class="bullet-line">        - why am I here? what is my purpose?</span>
<span class="bullet-line">        - what is reality?</span></pre>

    <p id="descrip4" class="hidden">to many, these
    questions hold a sacred importance. often, when approaching these questions, we
    use the same methods that have worked so well in the rest of society: we try to
    answer them. </p>
    
    <p id="descrip5" class="hidden">western philosophy, for example,
    has largely taken the approach of using logic and reasoning as
    a means to undestand these questions. an issue always arises, however,
    because these questions are of a different nature.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip6" class="hidden">life, reality, god, the human
    condition—are all inherently illogical. incomprehensible. undefinable.
    abstract. divine. </p>
    
    <p id="descrip7" class="hidden">what does this mean for our
    questions? well, it means they are unanswerable.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip8" class="hidden">this is the root of existential
    depression.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip9" class="hidden">we feel that if we are to truly
    understand our existence, we must find some sort of answer to these questions.
    and, inevitably, we fail. </p>
    
    <p id="descrip10" class="hidden">many people come to this
    realization, that the deepest questions in our lives do not have answers. but
    many then turn away, dismissing these questions as irrelevant, pointless, and a
    waste of time.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip11" class="hidden">the unanswerability
    of these questions does not mean they should go away. 
    they still probe at the deepest parts of who we are.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip12" class="hidden">it simply means we should change
    how we approach them.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip13" class="hidden">the way to understand these
    questions is through awareness. through experience. through interaction.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip14" class="hidden">think of these questions as philosphical hurdles. 
    when we try to jump over them, time and time again we fail. because they are special
     hurdles. unjumpable ones. </p>
    
    <p id="descrip15" class="hidden">there is no other side of the
    hurdle. in fact the notion doesn't even make sense.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip16" class="hidden"><span class=GramE>so</span> what
    should we do with the hurdles? we should examine them. we should play with
    them. we should investigate every nuance of what makes that hurdle what it is. </p>
    
    <p id="descrip17" class="hidden">to get closer to god, don't try to
    comprehend the divine—for it is fundamentally uncomprehendable. instead,
    seek the interaction that <em>is</em> divine—the interaction <em>with</em> the uncomprehendable.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip18" class="hidden">to find meaning in life, don't
    question the meaning of life. immerse yourself in life. feel life. investigate
    what makes you feel most human.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip19" class="hidden">to pursue a deeper understanding of reality, don't
    question it. become aware of it. connect with it. play with it. and a deep intimacy 
    with nature will penetrate your very being.</p>
    
    <p id="descrip20" class="hidden">much love,</p>
