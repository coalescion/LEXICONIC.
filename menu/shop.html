        the process of physically embedding wisdom in the real world is the most critical aspect of &thinsp;<a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a>
        for this, we rely upon people from all across the globe to play a part in putting up stickers in their own cities,
        in their own communities. we all have spots in the world that are special to usâ€”putting up a sticker that is
        meaningful to you allows others to be impacted positively by both the place and the message as well.
        to truly catalyze a global movement, we all have to participate. help us spread wisdom and become a part of something greater.
