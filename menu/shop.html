    <a href="../index.html" class="title">lexiconic.</a> for this, we rely upon people from all across the globe
    to play a part in putting up stickers in their own cities, in their own communities. we all have spots in the world
    that are special to us—putting up a sticker that is meaningful to you allows others to be impacted positively by
    both the place and the message as well. to truly catalyze a global movement, we all have to participate. help us
    spread wisdom and become a part of something greater.
