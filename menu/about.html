        this project first emerged from a simple mantra: “cultivate wisdom.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        in some ways, cultivating wisdom may seem like a solitary act—a way of life for the individual. 
        after all, it is through our personally lived experiences that we forage for our own bits of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
       upon reflection, however, one can quickly see that the human experience is not something unique to oneself. 
       it is a common language which unites eight billion people around the globe—all of which possess an experience of life that is just as vivid, 
       complex, and nuanced as both mine and yours. and not only can we learn from our own experiences of life, but we can learn tremendously
       from the understandings arising from the lives of others.
    </p>
    <p>
        from this basic realization, an idea was formed: to truly cultivate wisdom, we should together
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">cultivate a <em>community</em> dedicated to the cultivation of wisdom. </p>
    <p>
        and&thinsp;<a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a>&thinsp;was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        this is  <em>lexiconic.</em>—a medium which enables people to <a href="create.html" class="link"> share</a> their own personal phrases of wisdom with the world. 
        it is an immersive space where—in contrast to the vast oversaturation of content on social media—we have together 
        distilled wisdom from around the globe in a compact and easily accessible way.
    </p>
    <p>
        in addition to content, with <em>lexiconic.</em> we had a vision to attend closely to form—by <a href="shop.html" class="link"> embedding</a> wisdom within the physical world,
        we seek to reclaim the environmental, experiential aspect of the idea. not only does this encourage physical exploration, 
        but it unites all encounters of the bit of wisdom under a common experience—connecting people from all walks of life around not only the idea,
        but the shared experience of becoming aware of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        welcome to (y)&thinsp;our community. we hope that you will share your wisdom with us.
    </p>
    <pre>           much peace,</pre>
