    <p>    
        <a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a> is a new project with a big vision. many significant updates are coming in the next year, 
        and i will be working on the project full time beginning in october 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
        to name a few priorities:
    </p>
    <!-- <ul>
        <li>language compatibility
            <ul>
            <li>at lexiconic.global, we recognize that "global" is in the name. it is a priority that our platform is accesible to people around the globe with a variety of mother tongues,
                and to do that we understand the need for pages or translations in a variety of languages. compatibility for spanish, german, and chinese are coming soon.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>integration with artists
            <ul>
            <li>at its core, <a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a> is an artistic project, and aims to become a leading platform for artists to share their art.
                many new features to promote artistic involvement are coming soon.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>animation and apparel
            <ul>
            <li>we also have interest in making phrases more interactive via 2D animation, as well as create embroidered apparel to support the project as a whole.
                apparel will include both general "lexiconic." designs, as well as designs based from specific phrases (yours included).
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li>lexiconic.global.{spaces} 
            <ul>
            <li>there are many additional spaces that we feel could become embedded within lexiconic. for example,
                </li> lexiconic.
            </ul>
        </li> 
    </ul> -->

    <pre>some questions feel fundamental to the human condition. these include:
        * language compatibility
                - at lexiconic.global, we recognize that "global" is in the name. it is a priority that our platform is accesible to people
                  around the globe with a variety of mother tongues, and to do that we understand the need for pages or translations in a 
                  variety of languages. compatibility for spanish, french, german, and chinese are coming soon.
        * integration with artists
                - at its core, <a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a> is an artistic project, and aims to become a leading platform for artists to share their art.
                 many new features to promote artistic involvement are coming soon.
        * animation and apparel
                - we also have interest in making phrases more interactive via 2D animation, as well as create embroidered apparel to
                  support the project as a whole. apparel will include both general "lexiconic." designs, as well as designs based on

    <p>
      we are excited to bring these updates to the community, and are doing our best to make them happen. development will accelerate in october 2025.
