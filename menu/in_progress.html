        <a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a> is a new project with a big vision. many significant updates are coming in the next year, 
        and we soon plan to work on the project full time.
    </p>
    <p>
        to name a few priorities:
    </p>
    <ul id="in_prog">
        <li id="in_prog">language compatibility
            <ul id="in_prog">
            <li id="in_prog">at lexiconic.global, we recognize that "global" is in the name. it is a priority that our platform is accesible
                             to people around the globe with a variety of mother tongues,
                             and to do that we understand the need for pages or translations in a variety of languages.
                             compatibility for spanish, german, french, and chinese are coming soon.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="in_prog">integration with artists
            <ul id="in_prog">
            <li id="in_prog">at its core, <a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a> is an artistic project, and aims to become a leading platform for artists to share their art.
                             many new features to promote artistic involvement are coming soon.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="in_prog">animation and apparel
            <ul id="in_prog">
            <li id="in_prog">we also have interest in making phrases more interactive via 2D animation, as well as create embroidered apparel to support the project as a whole.
                             apparel will include both general "lexiconic." designs, as well as designs based from specific phrases (yours included).
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <!-- <li id="in_prog">lexiconic.global.{spaces} 
            <ul id="in_prog">
            <li id="in_prog">there are many additional spaces that we feel could become embedded within lexiconic. for example,
                </li> lexiconic.
            </ul>
        </li>  -->
    </ul>
