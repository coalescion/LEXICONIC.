        this project began with a simple concept—to cultivate wisdom in a way
        that highlights the experience of becoming aware of that wisdom. 
        in emphasizing the experiential component of encountering an idea, one can have a stronger,
        more personal connection with it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        art, thought, and ideas in general are often understood as consisting of two main components—content
        and form. although the rise of the internet and social media has allowed us to become 
        far more interconnected as a species, transmitting ideas and thought with ease, it has also 
        contributed to an oversaturation of content. this vast expanse of content within the digital 
        space has a couple of negative consequences:
    </p>
    <p>
        for one, it makes filtering out relevant, profound bits of wisdom from the noise immensely 
        difficult. if one discovers an insightful idea on twitter, for example, they had to scroll 
        through considerable distraction in order to uncover it.
    </p>
    <p>
        secondly, the ideas are distributed without much attention given to their form, 
        and without any attention given to the way in which they are encountered by the audience.
        if one hears something profound in a podcast, they could have been doing laundry, exercising,
        at work, etc.,—doing any thing at any place. there is no commonality that brings the observers
        of the idea together, nothing to shape the experience of becoming aware of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        with<a href="../index.html" class="title"> lexiconic.</a>, we had a vision to do this differently. by embedding wisdom within the
        physical world, we seek to reclaim the environmental, experiential aspect of the idea. 
        there seems a fundamental difference between encountering a bit of wisdom through a youtube
        video on your couch, and stumbling upon that same bit of wisdom while exploring a new area
        of town alone—while the conceptual effect on your mind may be similar, the experiential 
        effect on your spirit is incomparable. by attending to the form of an idea, we can cultivate
        not only the bit of wisdom itself, but also the experience of becoming aware of that wisdom;
        and it is this experience which allows something conceptual to touch the most nuanced crevices
        of both one's mind and spirit.
